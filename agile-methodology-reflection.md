# Agile Methodology Reflection

## Prompt 
As a group, answer the questions below. For each of these questions, consider specific examples to support your narrative.

* Reflect on your team's communication processes. How did Agile practices, such as **daily stand-up** meetings, facilitate communication and collaboration among team members?
* How did maintaining a **scrum board** play a role in the organization and delegation of tasks in your project?
* Reflect on your team's prioritization of tasks. How did your team create a **timeline for reaching MVP** and how did this prioritization assist in accomplishing your goals?
* What would you have done differently as a group to improve your communication, prioritization, or delegation of tasks?

## Reflection Response

### Communication Process
Since I worked alone, I didn’t have daily stand-ups. However, I used the concept by checking in with myself daily to assess progress, identify tasks, and address any roadblocks, which helped keep me on track.

### Role of the Scrum Board
The scrum board was crucial for organizing tasks. It helped me prioritize and track progress by visualizing tasks in the "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns. This made it easy to stay focused and ensure I was working on the most important tasks.

### Task Prioritization and Timeline
I created a timeline based on MVP features and prioritized tasks accordingly. Using the scrum board, I ensured that essential tasks were completed first, allowing me to hit the MVP deadline while avoiding unnecessary features.

### What I Would Have Done Differently
If I had a partner, daily check-ins and task delegation would’ve improved collaboration. I’d also have involved my partner in setting priorities and timeline discussions to better distribute workload and gain feedback.
