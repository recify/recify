# Recify - Recipe Finder

Created by Braily Guzman

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, Recify is for home cooks and food enthusiasts. It allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients they have dietary preference or metal type. This will help users discover new dishes and make meal planning easier.

## API & React Router

This application will use the Spoonacular API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php
- API endpoint #1 `/api/json/v1/1/random.php`
  - Fetches random recipes to show on the landing page
- API endpoint #2 `/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=Pizza`
  - Fetches a list of recipes based on user input
  - Used data values: `name`
- API endpoint #3 `/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=52772`
  - Fetches detailed information about a selected recipe.

This API does not require an API key.

## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

- On the `/` page, users can see random recipes and search recipes.
- On the `/recipes` page, users can **view a list of recipes matching their search criteria**.
- On the `/recipes/:recipeId` page, users can **see detailed information about a specific recipe, including ingredients and instructions**.

## ü§î Stretch User Stories

If time permits, the following stretch features will be implemented in order of priority:

- Users will be able to **save and view their favorite recipes using local storage**.
- Users will be able to **filter recipe based on dietary preferences (vegan, gluten-free, etc.).**
- Users will be able to **generate a shopping list based on selected recipes.**
